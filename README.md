Not many external libraries used. A RecyclerView was used to show the data. The jva.net.URL, java.net.HttpURLConnection (and more Java) libraries were used to retrieve data from https://api.github.com/users/JBossOutreach/repos and https://api.github.com/repos/JBossOutreach/lead-management-android/contributors etc.

Take note not to refresh the app too many times, as there is an API rate limit
